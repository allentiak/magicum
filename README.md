## Pronunciation

[IPA](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:International_Phonetic_Alphabet)^([key](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Latin_pronunciation)): _/'ma.ʝi.kum/, [ˈma.ʝɪ.kʊm]_

Whereas the original [_Classical Latin_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Latin) word should be pronounced _/ˈma.ɡi.kum/_ or _[ˈma.ɡɪ.kʊm]_, as the origin language of the original game's name is English, we use an English-like pronunciation.
